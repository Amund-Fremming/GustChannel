# Tasklist

# Left off

- tried to implement a claenup for failing task in client and group
- Use a flag with rwlcok and arc

- [ ] Purge functionality to client task
- [ ] Purge functionality to group task
- [ ] Way of removing group when it fails from broker
- [ ] Add registry
- [ ] Take in functions from library user
- [ ] Call functions from frontend
- [ ] functionality for sending to group except id (sender)

Registry solution 1
- Store functions as functions with a vec as params
- Create regisyter functions for adding funcitons with param length 1-5 or something
- Let these functions serialize the params, and create a new funciton of the registered function with vec as param
